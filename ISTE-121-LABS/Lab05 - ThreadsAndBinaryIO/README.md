## Finish Grade

Driver code:

- Start one thread per file found 10/10
- Wait for all threads to finish 0/10- missing
- Properly end use of ZipCityState.dat file 5/5
- Print size of ArrayList 5/5
- Print number of records written to ZipCityState.dat 5/5
- Write ArrayList as an object to CityArrayList.ob 5/5
- Prints correct size of the CityArrayList.ob file 5/5
- Take command line city names, print position, or not found 5/10 – the finishThred not called at the end
  
Threaded code:

- Opens this thread’s data file for reading 5/5
- Properly reads the data items 10/10
- Properly places city in array list 5/5
- Properly writes ZipCityState.dat file 10/10
- Find button works as expected find city names, print position, or not found 0/10 - missing
  
- Code works as expected 10/10
