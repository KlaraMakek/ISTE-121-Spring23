## Final grade

- GUI displays as expected (15/15)

- Calculate – only one calculation in the code (3/3)
- Save – calculates then saves in a CSV file (3/3)
- Clear – clears all fields (2/2)
- Exit – makes sure file is closed and exists the program (2/2)

Load:

- File/data doesn’t exist message appears when expected (5/5)
- Load method returns int value (-1 or record count) (0/5) – missing the method
- Display number of records loaded at end of load (5/5)
- Handles all possible errors, even if error not displayed (5/5)
- Previous: - problem with the counter conditions, and initial values
- Determines if there is a previous record to show, if not display a message (5/10) – implemented, but the condition are not ok
- Displays previous information from the list each time Prev is clicked (10/10)
- Next: - problem with the counter conditions, and initial values
- Determines if there is a next record to show, if not display message (5/10) – implemented, but the condition are not ok
- Displays next information from the list each time Next is clicked (10/10)
 
- Missing breaks in the switch/case, missing methods for every event (-10)
