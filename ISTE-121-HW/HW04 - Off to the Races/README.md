## Finish grade

- One AnimationTimer used for all racers (15/15)
- Specify number of threads from command line. (4/4)
- When no number is specified, 5 is the default. (3/3)
- All fixed values (numbers and others) are properly defined as constants (3/3)
- Calculated values, such as move-distance, frame width, are based on the size of the image (4/4)
 
- Frame title has “project and <your name>” in it. (3/3)
- The vertical black line is drawn on the right hand side of the frame, and is continuous, no gaps. (3/3)
- The finish line is calculated based on a percentage of screen size, or icon width (recommend: about 1.5x to 2x image width from right). (3/3)
- The screen width must be a calculated value based on the Icon used. (3/3)
- The screen height is dependent upon how many racers there are. (3/3)

The Pane class: (can be inner class)

- Pane for this class  (6/6)
 
Functionality:

- Images start on left of screen, races to the right. (3/3)
- Images pause one second before starting. (3/3)
- Image movements are based on random distance calculated from the icon width. (5/5)
- First image across is declared the winner and shown in the console output. (5/5)
- Use “synchronized” on some simple shared object to block other thread from declaring another winner. (5/5)
- All other threads are stopped. (5/5)

- Displays and runs as expected. (10/10)

Style:

- JavaDocs for every class and method (5/5)
- Follow coding style: indentation, use of white space for readability per Coding standards discussed in class. (5/5)
- Variables of appropriate access (private) (4/4)
