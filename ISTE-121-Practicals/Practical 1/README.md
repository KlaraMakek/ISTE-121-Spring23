## Final grade

Problem 1 - Counter (Threads) (50%) – CLO3

Driver code will:

- Create proper number of threads (5/5)
- Pass a thread number to the thread code (3/3)
- Wait for all threads to end (joins them) (5/5)
- Joins do not cause threads to run sequentially (one at a time) (5/5)
- Display the final value of the counter (2/2)
 
Thread code will:

- Set the thread’s name to the thread number given it (5/5)
- Display the Thread name and the counter  (5/5)
- Decrement the counter contiguously and sequentially (5/5)
- Thread safety is assured (5/5)
- Display the letter after the counter always in the same order (3/5) - cun2 < 4 instead od cun2 > 4
- Output is similar to shown, including good spacing (5/5)
 
Problem 2 – Byte I/O  (50%) – CLO2 – doWord() is not called at all

- Creates the GUI as shown (0/5) – not implemented
- Opens the binary file for reading (5/5)
- Reads each data item as expected (2.5/5) - partially
- Finds the lightest weight and tallest height (2/10) – partially, something
- Finds the players from the “Boston College” (0/5) - missing
- After end of file, displays person for both the lightest weight and the tallest height, with other details as specified. 0/10)
- After end of file, Displays all players from the “Boston College” (0/5)
- Properly take care of the file before the program ends. (0/5)-missint

P.S. Yes, I'm ashamed of my grade.
